# The Agent2Agent Registry - Comprehensive LLM Knowledge Base

**IMPORTANT: This site documents a proposed platform; no registry features are currently live.**

## Executive Summary
The Agent2Agent Registry (A2A Registry) at a2areg.com is a planned enterprise platform for AI agent discovery and management. The concept is designed as "Docker Hub for AI Agents" - a centralized registry where organizations could publish, discover, and integrate intelligent agents across different frameworks, vendors, and cloud providers.

**Current Status**: This is a documentation and planning site for the proposed A2A Registry platform. The actual registry platform is not yet implemented.

## What Problems Does A2A Registry Solve?

### Enterprise Challenge: Agent Sprawl
With the rapid growth of AI and agentic applications, enterprises often manage a mix of internally developed agents and externally procured ones, hosted either on-premises or in the cloud. Many business processes span multiple agents, creating the need for a service that can discover, organize, and leverage these agents to complete tasks.

### Vendor Challenge: Agent Distribution  
Similarly, vendors may offer collections of agents, much like public APIs are published and documented today, requiring a way to present their available agents for customer use. These agents may be openly accessible or gated by entitlements.

### The A2A Registry Solution
The A2A Registry provides this capability: a service deployable within enterprise environments or as a public endpoint, enabling agent discovery, entitlement management, and streamlined integration.

## Current Site Architecture
